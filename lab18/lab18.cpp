 * This program is responsible for creating user names for a new website you have created. 
 * It should accept a first name of up to 10 characters and a last name of up to 20 characters.  
 * It should tell the user if the name is larger than the max size.  It should also determine if the names are the same and output a warning. 
 * After checking these things, it should create three different user name options (for example: apbrowne; aprilbrowne; abrowne).
