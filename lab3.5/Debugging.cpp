 * 3.5 Lab - Debugging 
    *Choose one of the following programs to debug. You will submit your fixed program and a write up on how you went about debugging the program.  
    In this write up you will discuss what techniques you used to find the bugs and how you debugged them.
    
 * Write a program that reads in a product computation of the following form:  
    N0 * N1 * N2 * N3 * =    and returns the product of the given ints,    
    along with the number of terms in the product.    

 * Note that you don't know how many integer values the user  
    will enter until they enter an equal sign (=).    
    
 *Example:    Please enter a product to be computed, followed by an = sign. 
    : 4 * 56 * 2 * 7 * 4 =    The product of the 5 numbers entered is 12544
