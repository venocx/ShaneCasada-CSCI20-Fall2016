//1. Add a comment with name, date, discription of program
//2. Add rand to # include <random> 
//3. Add using namespace std;
//4. Add int main() {
//5. In main add the code for num gen that alows to pick between two numbers lets say 0-10 .
//6. Then add the code that allows the user to guess the two numbers.
//7. add a point system.
//8. If they don’t the program tells them either higher or lower and lets them guess until they win and lose 1 point from 10 for each incorrect guess.
//7. Then add an if else statement that alows the user to continue the game if picked the bad number. And says to player “higher” or “lower” as well as takes 1 point from 10 for each incorrect guess.
//8. Need a loop to go back to the start with that guessed number out or the picked numbers as well as lost a point.
//9. Need a a line of code to say that the player already picked that number and to pick again.  
//8. add if else statment that allows the num gen to end if picked right and restart.
//9. end int main with }
