/*ðŸ’€ A program that calculate a personâ€™s weekly wages based on hourly salary and hours. Then it determine how much they would get paid if they paid 17% in taxes. 
and creates a wage slip with name, hours, rate, gross pay, and net pay.*/

            1. I will first ask name
            2. Then amount of hours worked
            3. Have them put hourly_wage
            4. Calculate salary by Multiplying the number of hours they work per week 
            by your hourly wage. Than multiply that number by 52 (the number of weeks in a year).
