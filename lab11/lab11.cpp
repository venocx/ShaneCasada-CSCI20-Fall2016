 * Creating a program that will calculate the income tax, and amount owed or to be refunded for a person (or couple).  
 The program will take the following basic tax information: name, filing status (single or married), gross wages, salaries and tips, and the amount of tax withheld. 

 It will then calculate the taxes as follows:
    Add the three income sources (wages, interest and unemployment) together to get the adjusted gross income.
    Subtract the personal exemption of $3,900 and the standard deduction of $6,100. 
    For a joint (married) return, these amounts are subtracted for each person.
    If the resulting number is less than zero, then the owed tax is zero. 
    If the number is above zero, use the tax tables to calculate the tax.Run the equations from the worksheet Operators Worksheet.pdf
